* Package Manager
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h1-package-manager
:END:

*Dependencies*: Cask, pallet.

Third party libraries are managed by Cask and pallet.  Every morning I open up
the terminal and enter the =emacs.d= directory, type =cask update= will update
and byte-compile the packages listed in a file named =Cask=.  When you install
packages inside Emacs, =pallet= makes sure that =Cask= is updated accordingly.

* Org Mode
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h1-org-mode
:END:

#+ATTR_ORG: :width 700

- Scientific paper writing, with ~org-ref~ package.  The org file may be exported
  to nearly all well-known format.  I've been using Org mode for dissertation,
  conference paper, slides (~beamer~) and much more.
- A complete TODO system, can be as simple or as complicated as possible.
- Agenda, with habits tracking, compatible with Google Calendar events.

* Bibliography Manager
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h1-bibliography-manager
:END:

This is a killer feature for scientific paper writing in Org-mode.

~helm-bibtex~ allows fuzzy-search on the bibtex file.

#+ATTR_ORG: :width 700
[[file:docs_src/img/bibtex-search.png]]

Associate PDF file, note file with a bibtex entry, and jump among them.
Specifically, {{{kbd(C-c o p)}}} opens the PDF file, {{{kbd(C-c o n)}}} opens the note file
and {{{kbd(C-c o c)}}} jumps to the bibtex entry.  For example, when you are viewing
the PDF in Emacs, {{{kbd(C-c o n)}}} opens the note file (create one if necessary),
{{{kbd(C-c o c)}}} jumps to the bibtex entry for this PDF file.

Cleanup/format bibtex entries, auto construct keys for bibtex entries.  You
could copy a bibtex entry from online, and press {{{kbd(C-c C-c)}}}, the entries will
be cleanup as follows.  The ~timestamp~ is automatically inserted.

With the help of ~org-ref,~ we can quickly insert citations to org files, which
can be exported to TeX, PDF or HTML with appropriate reference list.

* Email
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h1-email
:END:

#+ATTR_ORG: :width 700
[[file:docs_src/img/mu4e.png]]

A full-fledged email client with ~mu4e~.  Current settings are compatible with
multiple Gmail and Office 365 accounts.

* Editing Enhancement
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h1-editing-enhancement
:END:

** Writeroom with Fill-column Indicator
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h2-writeroom-with-fill-column-indicator
:END:

The buffer content is centered, especially useful when you have a wide screen.
This is not compatible with =linum-mode= (said to be fixed in Emacs 26), which I
never use.  ~fill-column-indicator~ shows a dimmed white line at ~fill-column~.

** Whitespace
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h2-whitespace
:END:

It highlights trailing spaces, leading/trailing empty lines, and automatically
cleans up them when saved.
